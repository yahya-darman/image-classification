Converting the outcome variable to a factor
```{r}
# Create a copy of the original dataset
trainData_modified <- trainData

# Convert the outcome variable to a factor
trainData_modified$y <- as.factor(trainData_modified$y)
```

Train Various Models
```{r}
# Train logistic regression
logistic_model <- train(y ~ ., data = trainData_modified, method = "glm", family = "binomial")
```

```{r}
# Train random forest
rf_model <- train(y ~ ., data = trainData_modified, method = "rf")
```

```{r}
# Train support vector machine
svm_model <- train(y ~ ., data = trainData_modified, method = "svmRadial")
```

Evaluate Model Performance
```{r}
# Predictions for logistic regression
logistic_predictions <- predict(logistic_model, newdata = testData)
logistic_accuracy <- mean(logistic_predictions == testData$y)
print(paste("Logistic Regression Accuracy:", logistic_accuracy))

# Predictions for random forest
rf_predictions <- predict(rf_model, newdata = testData)
rf_accuracy <- mean(rf_predictions == testData$y)
print(paste("Random Forest Accuracy:", rf_accuracy))

# Predictions for support vector machine
svm_predictions <- predict(svm_model, newdata = testData)
svm_accuracy <- mean(svm_predictions == testData$y)
print(paste("Support Vector Machine Accuracy:", svm_accuracy))
```
